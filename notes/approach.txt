### This file just discusses the approach to be followed in the
# In train posts structure, we have different variables for every post.

First level filter: language

Quantitative estimates from user's usage history relation with
author and blog

When traversing through train users, we do have blog id but we don't have author id. In order to have post mapping
with blog and author, either we can traverse through train posts first and build a hash map.

We can look into this later during execution issues.

So after filtering through language,
we create a user relation to posts with liked blogs (and liked authors).
This gives a set of posts that relate with user history.

Second thing we need from user history is probably ngram likeliness matrix.
This spans over tags, blogname and post title of liked posts.
First collect a structure for dominant words in these posts combined.
Then explore relation with this structure in testing time post. This gives some measure of relation

At this stage we can get a good recall by using top score posts using both approaches
To create a better precision, we now need to run this approach through some learning process
